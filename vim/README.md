# Neovim Configuration

This is the personal Neovim configuration of Gabriele Vassallo.

## Plugins

To manage Neovim plugins I decided to use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), a plugin management system that makes a well orgazined Vim directory. Also Vundle ensures that the latest versions of your plugins are installed and makes it easy to keep them up to date.

The first section of the .vimrc file contains the complete list of plugins . Useful links to some of them:
