# Vim Configuration 

This is the personal Vim configuration of Gabriele Vassallo. 


## Plugins 

To manage Vim plugins I decided to use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), a plugin management system that makes a well orgazined Vim directory. Also Vundle ensures that the latest versions of your plugins are installed and makes it easy to keep them up to date.
